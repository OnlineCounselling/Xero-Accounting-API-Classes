# Xero-Accounting-API-Classes
These are java classes that are used with the xero.com accounting api.  We've used them in our <a href="https://onlinecounselling.io">online counselling</a> software to communicate with Xero.

Add the classes to your project and update the package name for your projects.

We've also added the source file to some other well known repositories.<br/>
